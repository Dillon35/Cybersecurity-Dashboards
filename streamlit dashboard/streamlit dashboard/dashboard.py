                        <p> Attacks on networks are becoming more sophisticated and pose a serious threat to various types of infrastructures. 
                          Unavailability of services due to various forms of DDOS attacks drastically reduces the confidence in the security of that stored data and the ability for a 
                          business/infrastructure to operate efficently.  Throughout this dashboard, the user will be able to view various interactive dashboards that pertain to a real-life 
                          dataset that contains various forms of DDOS attacks.  This dataset includes a ten month timeframe in which network flows were documentated and processed through 
                          the companies custom built IDS(intrusion detection system).  After their IDS processed the network flows, their system indicates what network flows were DDOS 
                          attacks and what network flows were not.  With this information, I was able to create various interactive dashboards that the user will be able to access to gain a better 
                          knowledge on various aspects of DDOS attacks to a real-life network environment.  The user will gain some knowledge in understanding how, when, and through what protocol
                          these malicious acts were conducted in.</p>

                          <p1>HTTP Flood attacks utilize what appear to be legitimate HTTP GET or POST requests to attack a web server or application. 
                            These flooding DDoS attacks often rely on a botnet, which is a group of Internet-connected computers that have been maliciously appropriated 
                            through the use of malware such as a Trojan Horse. </p1>
                        <p>tcp_syn_f(TCP SYN-Flood-Attack):</p>
                          <p1>How does the TCP SYN flood attack work?
                            A TCP SYN flood DDoS attack occurs when the attacker floods the system with SYN requests in order to overwhelm the target and make it unable to 
                            respond to new real connection requests. It drives all of the target server's communications ports into a half-open state. </p1>
                        <p>tcp_red_w (Code Red Worm): </p>
                          <p1>Code Red is a worm, which is a computer attack that propagates through networks without user intervention. This particular worm makes use of a 
                            vulnerability in Microsoft's Internet Information Services (IIS) Web server softwareâ€”specifically, a buffer overflow.</p1>
                        <p>udp_f (UDP-Flood-Attack): </p>
                          <p1>A UDP flood is a form of volumetric Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack where the attacker targets and overwhelms random ports on the host with IP 
                            packets containing User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets.</p1>
                        <p>icmp_smf (Smurf): </p>
                          <p1>A smurf attack is a form of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that occurs at the network layer. Smurfing attacks are named after the 
                            malware DDoS. Smurf, which enables hackers to execute them.</p1>
                        <p>tcp_land (LAND Attack): </p>
                          <p1> A LAND Attack is a Layer 4 Denial of Service (DoS) attack in which, the attacker sets the source and destination information of a TCP segment 
                            to be the same. A vulnerable machine will crash or freeze due to the packet being repeatedly processed by the TCP stack.</p1>
                        <p>tcp_w32_w (Blaster Worm): </p>
                          <p1>exploits vulnerabilities in the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) implementation of certain versions of Microsoft Windows. 
                          In addition to performing all of the attributes of a worm such as locating and infecting other hosts, this worm also attempts to conduct a denial-of-service (DOS) 
                            attack on the Microsoft Windows update Web server.</p1>
                        <p>icmp_f (ICMP-Flood): </p>
                          <p1>An Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) flood DDoS attack, also known as a Ping flood attack, is a common Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack in which an attacker
