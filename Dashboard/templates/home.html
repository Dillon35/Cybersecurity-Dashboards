    <p>Attacks on networks are becoming more sophisticated and pose a serious threat to various types of infrastructures. Unavailability of services due to various forms of DDOS attacks drastically reduces the confidence in the security of that stored data and the ability for a business/infrastructure to operate efficently.  Throughout this webpage, the user will be able to view various interactive dashboards that pertain to a real-life dataset that contains various forms of DDOS attacks.  This dataset includes a ten month timeframe in which network flows were documentated and process through the companies custom built IDS(intrusion detection system).  After their IDS processed the network flows their system indicates what network flows were DDOS attacks and what network flows werent.  With this information, I was able to create various interactive dashboards that the user will be able to access to gain a better knowledge on various aspects of DDOS attacks to a real-life network environment.   </p>
